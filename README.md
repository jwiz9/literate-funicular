  ## Usage
  After installing dependencies, you can run ```npm start``` to start the local server. Use Insomnia to test the server routes. The base routes are /api/users and /api/thoughts. Use thought-routes.js and user-routes.js as reference to more valid routes if you want to find specific users or thoughts. You can also use this [google drive video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14kcF7n1Yb8S3UuL7r3b_cxnCAHKzyWKL/view) as a walkthrough.
